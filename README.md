# trade-physic-script
manuall script written on pythonautogui to farm trades between 2 accounts

how to use:
1. make sure you have your steam and SDA on english.
2. put the second acc on ASF, to autoaccept gift trades.
3. your first account should be connected to SDA.
4. open .py file and insert trade link of second acc (the one on ASF).
5. save changes.
6. open browser with your first acc, make browser scale to 80%.
7. set everything up as on _example.png. It shouldnt be pixelperfect, but try to do it similar.
8. Browser top left corner should touch top left corner of the screen.
9. choose Banana game (to trade that you need to have a lot of splitted common Bananas from Banana game).
10. run script and make sure that nothing covers browser or SDA confirm window.
11. if you have slow PC or bad internet, just increase the delay (time.sleep(3.000))
